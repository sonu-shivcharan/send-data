# Send-Data

Welcome to the Send-Data project! This project allows you to collect and send formatted data via WhatsApp using the WhatsApp API. By filling out a form on the HTML page, users can provide their personal information, such as full name, gender, date of birth, birth time, birth country, state, and city. The provided information is then saved using JavaScript objects and transformed into a formatted message to be sent to a specified WhatsApp number using the WhatsApp API.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: This HTML file contains the form element that users can fill out to provide their data.
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling the HTML elements and making the form visually appealing.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the form submission, data storage using objects, and message formatting for WhatsApp.
- `README.md` (this file): Provides information about the project, its structure, and usage instructions.

## Usage Instructions

To use the Send-Data project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Fill out the form with the requested personal information, such as full name, gender, date of birth, birth time, birth country, state, and city.
4. Click the submit button to save the data and trigger the formatting of the message.
5. Ensure that you have set up the WhatsApp API correctly, including obtaining the necessary credentials and configuring the appropriate phone number to receive messages.
6. Once the message is formatted, it will be sent to the specified WhatsApp number using the WhatsApp API.

Please note that you need to set up the WhatsApp API according to your requirements and integrate it with the project. Additionally, make sure to review the API documentation for further details on how to handle message sending.
